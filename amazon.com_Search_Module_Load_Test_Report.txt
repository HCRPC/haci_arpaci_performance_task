Amazon.com Search Module Load Test Report
Introduction
This report details the load test scenarios and a basic JMeter implementation for the search module of n11.com. The objective is to investigate the behavior of the search module under load and provide a foundation for further performance analysis. Due to persistent Cloudflare blocking of direct access to n11.com, I continued testing on amazon.com. The limits specified in the assertion were chosen arbitrarily, as no specific requirements were provided in the task.
Test Scenarios
The following test scenarios are designed to cover typical user interactions with an e-commerce search functionality. Each scenario outlines the objective, steps, and expected results.

1. Successful Product Search
Objective: To verify that the search module can successfully process common product queries and return relevant results under load.

Scenario Steps:
1User navigates to the amazon.com homepage .
2User enters a 5 different product names ( "laptop", "shoes", "t-shirt", “ssd”, “men”) into the search bar.
3User initiates the search.
4Expected Result: The system returns a search results page displaying a list of relevant products. 
		* Response Status Code 200
		* Respose Header Assertion : Content-Type: text/html;charset=UTF-8
		* Duration Assertion: <2000 miliseconds
		* Size Assertion: <230000
		* Response Body Assertion: Contains Search Term
Inputs:
User: 1
Ramp-up: 1
Loop Count: 15
     * Include counter: 5 


2. Product Search With Special Chars - No Results
Objective: To assess the system's behavior and performance when a search query yields no matching products.

Scenario Steps:
1    User navigates to the amazon.com homepage .
2    User enters a Special Char search item name (“$$$$${}&&&&&&”)
3    User initiates the search.
4    Expected Result: The system returns a search results page indicating no products found (e.g., "No results for your search query"). 
           * Response Status Code 200
	   * Respose Header Assertion : Content-Type: text/html;charset=UTF-8
	   * Duration Assertion: <1400 miliseconds
	   * Size Assertion: <150000
	   * Response Body Assertion: Contains Search “No results for your search query”
Inputs:
User: 1
Ramp-up: 1
Loop Count: 5
    

3. Search with Invalid Search Input
Objective: To assess the system's behavior and performance when a search query yields no matching products.

Scenario Steps:
1    User navigates to the amazon.com homepage .
2    User enters a Special Char search item name (“ğpüüğpüğşnifnüğfşüğşğünbüfş).
3    User initiates the search.
4    Expected Result: The system should handle the input gracefully, either by sanitizing it, returning no results, or displaying an appropriate error message without crashing or exposing vulnerabilities. Response time should be acceptable.
